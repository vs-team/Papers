Adding multiplayer support to games is a desirable feature to increase the game popularity by attracting millions of players \cite{ducheneaut2006alone}. The benefit for the popularity is given by the fact that, after completing the singleplayer experience, the user may keep playing the game online in cooperation or against other players, in different modes that are more interesting and challenging than their singleplayer counterparts \cite{pantel2002impact}. Multiplayer games are very sensitive to network delay (latency), packet loss, and bandwidth limits, thus requiring heavy optimizations that are different and depend on the specific instance of the game. For instance, a Turn-based strategy game will require less optimization with respect to bandwidth usage or delays, because the data transmission happens once.
