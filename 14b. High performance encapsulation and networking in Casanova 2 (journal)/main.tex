% Abstract (Do not use inserted blank lines, i.e. \\) 
\abstract{\textit{Encapsulation} is a programming technique that helps developers keeping code readable and maintainable. However, encapsulation in modern object oriented languages often causes significant runtime overhead. Developers must choose between clean encapsulated code or fast code. In the application domain of computer games, speed of execution is of utmost importance, which means that the choice between clean and fast usually is decided in favor of the latter. In this paper we discuss how encapsulation is embedded in the Casanova 2 game development language, and show how Casanova 2 allows developers to write encapsulated game code which, thanks to extensive optimization, achieves at the same time high levels of performance. Furthermore, we show that the abstractions provided by Casanova so far cover no more than the tip of the iceberg: we document a further extension in the traditionally challenging domain of networking and show how the language can provide significant improvement in productivity.}

\section{Results}

This section may be divided by subheadings. It should provide a concise and precise description of the experimental results, their interpretation as well as the experimental conclusions that can be drawn.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Subsection}
\subsubsection{Subsubsection}

Bulleted lists look like this:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,labelsep=4mm]
\item	First bullet
\item	Second bullet
\item	Third bullet
\end{itemize}

Numbered lists can be added as follows:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*,labelsep=3mm]
\item	First item
\item	Second item
\item	Third item
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Figures, Tables and Schemes}

All figures and tables should be cited in the main text as Figure 1, Table 1, etc.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
%\includegraphics[width=3cm]{logo-mdpi}
\caption{This is a figure, Schemes follow the same formatting. If there are multiple panels, they should be listed as: (\textbf{a}) Description of what is contained in the first panel. (\textbf{b}) Description of what is contained in the second panel. Figures should be placed in the main text near to the first time they are cited. A caption on a single line should be centered.}
\end{figure}   

All figures and tables should be cited in the main text as Figure 1, Table 1, etc. All figures and tables should be cited in the main text as Figure 1, Table 1, etc. All figures and tables should be cited in the main text as Figure 1, Table 1, etc. All figures and tables should be cited in the main text as Figure 1, Table 1, etc.

\subsection{Formatting of Mathematical Components}

This is an example of an equation:

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{S}
\end{equation}

%% If the documentclass option "submit" is chosen, please insert a blank line before and after any math environment (equation and eqnarray environments). This ensures correct linenumbering. The blank line should be removed when the documentclass option is changed to "accept" because the text following an equation should not be a new paragraph. 
Please punctuate equations as regular text. Theorem-type environments (including propositions, lemmas, corollaries etc.) can be formatted as follows:
%% Example of a theorem:
\begin{Theorem}
Example text of a theorem.
\end{Theorem}
The text continues here. Proofs must be formatted as follows:

%% Example of a proof:
\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem 1]
Text of the proof. Note that the phrase `of Theorem 1' is optional if it is clear which theorem is being referred to.
\end{proof}

\section{Discussion}

This section may be divided by subheadings. Authors should discuss the results and how they can be interpreted in perspective of previous studies and of the working hypotheses. The findings and their implications should be discussed in the broadest context possible. Future research directions may also be highlighted.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Materials and Methods}

This section should be divided by subheadings. Materials and Methods should be described with sufficient details to allow others to replicate and build on published results. Please note that publication of your manuscript implicates that you must make all materials, data, and protocols associated with the publication available to readers. Please disclose at the submission stage any restrictions on the availability of materials or information. New methods and protocols should be described in detail while well-established methods can be briefly described and appropriately cited.

Research manuscripts reporting large datasets that are deposited in a publicly available database should specify where the data have been deposited and provide the relevant accession numbers. If the accession numbers have not yet been obtained at the time of submission, please state that they will be provided during review. They must be provided prior to publication.

\section{Conclusions}

This section is not mandatory, but can be added to the manuscript if the discussion is unusually long or complex.
