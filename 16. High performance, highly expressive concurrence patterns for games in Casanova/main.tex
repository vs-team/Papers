Writing AI is complicated and takes time to define its design
\\----------------------\\
An AI should be:
-easy to write
-easy to express hierarchical behavior
\\----------------------\\
Writing AI require ad-hoc structures and operators
\\----------------------\\
Our contribution
\\----------------------\\
We present some new operators for expressing AI behavior
\\----------------------\\
We use those operators to compare several implementations of modern AI written with the Unity3D engine pointing out performance and readability\\
-Hierarchical AI\\
-Decision trees\\
-HTN
\\----------------------\\
We study the resulting design patterns that arise from the samples
\\----------------------\\
We conclude that in Casanova there are no support structures, and the resulting code is compact/small when compared with C\# in Unity3D
