CHAPTER 1 
 
- Maybe 1.4 should come after the problem statement or included in problem statement.
- Add a research statement to the problem statement section.
- Metodology (how we are doing things).
- Contribution of the thesis (which could be the scientific relevance but then put it after the problem statement).
- Add a chapter about the thesis

CHAPTER 2
- Add an example about why regular expressions are insufficient to parse context-free grammars and a reference for this claim.
- Add a section on DSL's.
- Networking in games.

CHAPTER 3
- Move the section about Casanova 2 into a new chapter.
- Move Casanova 2.5 into a separate chapter. (Casanova has a dedicated chapter after this).

CHAPTER 7
- Divide this into two chapters: Discussion and future works where we discuss for example the Yacc parser from language syntax and Metacasanova syntax
- Another chpater has the answer of the problem statement (conclusion).

GENERAL:
- Literal quotes come in double quotes, all the rest in single quotes.
- Put a dash between meta and compiler everywhere. Same thing for Meta-casanova.
