the teaching of computer games as an academic subject for
 students at university level. The benefits,   challenges   and   problems   of   teaching   game design and game programming are investigated and disÂ­cussed. We present an overview of experiences with two 
different   approaches   to   game   programming, one in Magdeburg, Germany, and one in Dunedin, New Zealand.  A comparison and a list  of practical  advice for lecturers of similar courses concludes the 
paper. }
