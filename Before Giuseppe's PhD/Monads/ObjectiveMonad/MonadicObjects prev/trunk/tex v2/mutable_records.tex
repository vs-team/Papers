\section{Mutable Records}
We build mutable records in addition to our preceding operators. A record simply needs labels and the possiblity to (mutably) select a
field from a record. Since we want to ensure mutability, we want our selection operator to take as input a reference to our record and
to return as output a reference to the selected field; references can be assigned and evaluated (thanks to the $:=$, $*=$ and $eval$
operators) and this is what does guarantee mutability:

\begin{verbatim}
class (RefSt ref st s) => Record r ref st s where
  type Label r :: * -> *
  (<=) :: ref s r -> Label r a -> ref s a
\end{verbatim}
