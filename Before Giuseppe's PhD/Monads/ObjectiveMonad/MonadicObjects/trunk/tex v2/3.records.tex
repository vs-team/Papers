\section{Records}
We build mutable records in addition to our preceding operators. A record simply needs labels and the possiblity to (mutably) select a
field from a record. Since we want to ensure mutability, we want our selection operator to take as input a reference to our record and
to return as output a reference to the selected field; references can be assigned and evaluated (thanks to the $:=$, $*=$ and $eval$
operators) and this is what does guarantee mutability:

\begin{lstlisting}
class (State st m) => Record r st m where
  data Label st r :: * -> *
  (<==) :: (Ref st) m r -> Label st r a -> (Ref st) m a\end{lstlisting}
