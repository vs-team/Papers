\section{Mutable Objects}
We now implement mutable objects. We start with inheritance:
\begin{lstlisting}
data Inherit x = Inherit x

instance (o ~ (BaseCons bo 'Cons' no), Record o ST s => Object o ST s where
  type Base o = bo
  get_base self_ref =
	StRef(do ((BaseCons base) 'Cons' tl) <- eval self_ref
           return base)
       (\base' -> do (_ 'Cons' tl) <- eval self_ref
           self_ref := ((Inherit base') 'Cons' tl)
           return ())

  ...

instance (o ~ (Unit 'Cons' so), Record o ST s => Object o ST s where
  type Base o = o
  get_base self_ref = self_ref

  ...
\end{lstlisting}
In our mutable encoding the first field of the object must be either the value of the inherited value or unit when the object does not inherit anything.

Methods enjoy the same implementation in both cases, so we just give one:
\begin{lstlisting}
data MethodCons t a b = MethodCons(t -> a -> (b,t))

instance (o ~ (Unit 'Cons' so), Record o ST s => Object o ST s where
  ...

  type Method ro st a b = MethodCons ro a b
  self_ref <=| (Label read write) = 
             \x -> do self <- eval self_ref
                      let (MethodCons m) = read self
                          (res,self') = m self x
                      self_ref := self'
                      return res
\end{lstlisting}

It can prove very useful to take advantage of our existing infrastructure to create methods from references and statements, so that the user of our system will not be forced to define methods by explicitly tracking mutations to the value of $this$; for this reason we add a function to the $Object$ predicate that converts a method from reference to state into our format (the implementation here is the same for both instances of $Object$, so we provide only one:
\begin{lstlisting}
class (Record o st s, Recursive o, ro~Rec o) => Object o st s where
  ...
  mk_method :: (StRef o o -> a -> st o b) -> Method ro st a b

instance (o ~ (Unit 'Cons' so), Record o ST s => Object o ST s where
  ...
  mk_method m = Method(\this->\args->
                         let (ST res_st) = m state_ref args
                         in res_st this)
\end{lstlisting}
