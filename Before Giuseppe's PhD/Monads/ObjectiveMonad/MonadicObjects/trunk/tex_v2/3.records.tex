We build mutable records in addition to our preceding 
 operators. A record simply needs labels and the possiblity 
to (mutably) select a field from a record. Since we want to 
ensure mutability, we want our selection operator to take as 
input a reference to our record and to return as output a 
reference to the selected field; references can be assigned and 
evaluated (thanks to the $:=$, $*=$ and $eval$ operators):

\begin{lstlisting}
class (State st) => Record r st where
  data Label st r :: * -> *
  data Field st :: * -> *
  (<==) :: Memory m => (Ref st) m r -> Label st r (Field st a) -> (Ref st) m a
a\end{lstlisting}
