The optimization of our queries is a simple greedy algorithm that recursively traverses a query tree in search of certain local patterns. We use a subset of the equations coming from relational algebra [].

Filtering is idempotent:

$\sigma_{A}(R)=\sigma_{A}\sigma_{A}(R)\,\!$

Subsequent filters can be merged into just one:

$\sigma_{A \land B}(R)=\sigma_{A}(\sigma_{B}(R))=\sigma_{B}(\sigma_{A}(R))$

The filtering of a cartesian product can be decomposed into three sub-filters on the branches of the cartesian product and the resulting cartesian product:

$\sigma_{A}(R \times P) = \sigma_{B \wedge C \wedge D}(R \times P) = \sigma_{D}(\sigma_{B}(R) \times \sigma_{C}(P))$

As long as the required labels are maintained, a filtering and a projection can be swapped:

$\pi_{a_1, ...,a_n}(\sigma_A( R )) = \sigma_A(\pi_{a_1, ...,a_n}( R ))\;\;\;\mathrm{where}\;\;\mathrm{fields\ in}\ A \subseteq \{a_1,...,a_n\}$


The main task of our optimizer thus becomes that of applying these rules and pushing filter operations as deep as possible in the optimized query. This way filtering happens as early as possible and all subsequent operations have less elements to process.

The first definition we give is a type class that describes a query which can be optimized. This type class has a type function, $Optimized$, which returns the shape (the type) of the optimized query and a function $optimize$ which takes the original query and returns its optimized counterpart:
\begin{lstlisting}
class OptimizableQuery q where
  type Optimized q :: *
  optimize :: q -> Optimized q
\end{lstlisting}


The simplest instance of an optimizable query is, of course, the basic relation. In this case the optimization is simply the identity function:
\begin{lstlisting}
instance OptimizableQuery [a] where
  type Optimized [a] = [a]
  optimize q = q
\end{lstlisting}


Now we give a series of instances of optimizable queries which are only used to recursively traverse the query in search for other places where we can perform the optimization. Projections of optimizable queries are optimized by building the projection of the optimized argument:
\begin{lstlisting}
instance OptimizableQuery q => 
         OptimizableQuery (Project fields q) where
  type Optimized (Project fields q) = 
          Project fields (Optimized q)
  optimize (Project fields q) = 
          Project fields (optimize q)
\end{lstlisting}

Cartesian products of optimizable queries are optimized by building the join of the optimized arguments:
\begin{lstlisting}
instance (OptimizableQuery q1, OptimizableQuery q2) => 
          OptimizableQuery (Join q1 q2) where
  type Optimized (Join q1 q2) = 
       Join (Optimized q1) (Optimized q2)
  optimize (Join q1 q2) = 
       Join (optimize q1) (optimize q2)
\end{lstlisting}

The optimization of a filtering is the filtering of the optimized inner query:
\begin{lstlisting}
instance OptimizableQuery q => OptimizableQuery (Filter cond q) where
  type Optimized (Filter cond q) = Filter cond (Optimized q)
  optimize (Filter cond q) = Filter cond (optimize q)
\end{lstlisting}

The optimization of two nested filterings where both conditions are identical simply removes the redundant filtering and optimizes the resulting query:
\begin{lstlisting}
instance (StaticallyEquals cond1 cond2, 
          OptimizableQuery (Filter cond1 q)) => 
          OptimizableQuery (Filter cond1 (Filter cond2 q)) where
  type Optimized (Filter cond1 (Filter cond2 q)) = 
         Optimized (Filter cond1 q)
  optimize (Filter cond1 (Filter cond2 q)) = 
         optimize (Filter cond1 q)
\end{lstlisting}

The $StaticallyEquals$ predicate checks whether two conditions are exactly the same \textit{at compile-time}; this requires a mechanism for encoding constants as types (as we are doing with integers).

\begin{lstlisting}
class StaticallyEquals cond1 cond2
\end{lstlisting}

The constants used and their encoding depend on the application and the elements of our queries. This means that the $StaticallyEquals$ predicate will potentially need many domain-specific instances. What we can define about this predicate is the traversal of conditions:

\begin{lstlisting}
instance StaticallyEquals True True

instance (StaticallyEquals a a', StaticallyEquals b b') =>
          StaticallyEquals (And a a') (And b b')

instance (StaticallyEquals a a', StaticallyEquals b b') =>
          StaticallyEquals (Or a a') (Or b b')

instance (StaticallyEquals a a', StaticallyEquals b b') =>
          StaticallyEquals (Equals a a') (Equals b b')

instance StaticallyEquals (Item n) (Item n)
\end{lstlisting}

Notice that there is an obvious overlapping between the last two instances: this is not really a problem since we can either use a most specific match (if the second instance can be matched, then the first is ignored) or we can order the instances so that the least specific instances are checked only if the most specific fail.

Two nested filterings are merged into a single filtering with the two original conditions merged with an $And$ and the result is optimized (if the two conditions are not the same, in which case the previous rule is used):
\begin{lstlisting}
instance (not(StaticallyEquals cond1 cond2), 
          OptimizableQuery (Filter (And cond1 cond2) q)) => 
          OptimizableQuery (Filter cond1 (Filter cond2 q)) where
  type Optimized (Filter cond1 (Filter cond2 q)) = 
          Optimized (Filter (And cond1 cond2) q)
  optimize (Filter cond1 (Filter cond2 q)) = 
          optimize (Filter (And cond1 cond2) q)
\end{lstlisting}

We use the type-level $not(X)$ operator to express failure in proving the $X$ predicate.

A project within a filtering can be swapped and the result optimized, provided that the filtering condition is correctly offset since the indices of the various fields are now different:
\begin{lstlisting}
instance (Remappable cond fields, 
          OptimizableQuery (Filter (Remap cond fields) q)) => 
          OptimizableQuery (Filter cond (Project fields q)) where
  type Optimized (Filter cond (Project fields q)) = 
          Project fields (Optimized (Filter (Remap cond fields) q)))
  optimize (Filter cond (Project fields q)) = 
          Project fields (optimze (Filter (remap cond fields) q)))
\end{lstlisting}

Remapping a condition so that it looks up the correct fields in a value before the remapping performed by the projection:
\begin{lstlisting}
class Remappable cond fields where
  type Remap cond fields :: *
  remap :: cond -> fields -> Remap cond fields
\end{lstlisting}

To instance this predicate we will iterate the various $Item$s in $fields$ and for the $n^{th}$ $Item\ i$ we replace its index $n$ with $i$. We define another predicate (which is identical to $Remappable$ but with an explicit accumulator argument to track the index of each item):
\begin{lstlisting}
class RemappableAux cond fields acc where
  type RemapAux cond fields acc :: *
  remap_aux :: cond -> fields -> acc -> RemapAux cond fields acc  
\end{lstlisting}

The conversion rule states that remapping can be computed with our auxiliary predicate provided that the starting index is zero:
\begin{lstlisting}
instance RemappableAux cond fields 0 => Remappable cond fields where
  type Remap cond fields = RemapAux cond fields 0
  remap cond fields = remap_aux cond fields 0
\end{lstlisting}

When all fields are processed ($fields$ is empty), then no mapping is necessary:
\begin{lstlisting}
instance RemappableAux cond () n where
  type RemapAux cond fields n = cond
  remap_aux cond fields = cond
\end{lstlisting}

When $fields$ is not empty, then we replace the current item with its index in the condition and then we iterate:
\begin{lstlisting}
instance (Natural n, Natural i,
          RemappableAux cond fields (n+1),
          MappableItem n i cond) =>
          RemappableAux cond (Item i, fields) n where
  type RemapAux cond (Item i, fields) n = 
          RemapAux (MapItem n i cond) fields (n+1)
  remap_aux cond (Item i, fields) n = 
          remap_aux (map_item n i cond) fields (n+1)
\end{lstlisting}

The mapping of conditions is relatively straightforward. The mapping predicate is defined as:
\begin{lstlisting}
class MappableItem i i' cond where
  type MapItem i i' cond :: *
  map_item :: i -> i' -> cond -> MapItem i i' cond
\end{lstlisting}

While most instances simply traverse the condition tree (in a fashion similar to []):
\begin{lstlisting}
instance MappableItem i i' True where
  type MapItem i i' True = True
  map_item i i' True = True

instance (MappableItem i i' a,
          MappableItem i i' b) =>
          MappableItem i i' (And a b) where
  type MapItem i i' (And a b) = And (MapItem i i' a) (MapItem i i' b)
  map_item i i' (And a b) = And (map_item i i' a) (map_item i i' b)

instance (MappableItem i i' a,
          MappableItem i i' b) =>
          MappableItem i i' (Or a b) where
  type MapItem i i' (Or a b) = Or (MapItem i i' a) (MapItem i i' b)
  map_item i i' (Or a b) = Or (map_item i i' a) (map_item i i' b)

instance (MappableItem i i' a,
          MappableItem i i' b) =>
          MappableItem i i' (Equals a b) where
  type MapItem i i' (Equals a b) = Equals (MapItem i i' a) (MapItem i i' b)
  map_item i i' (Equals a b) = Equals (map_item i i' a) (map_item i i' b)
\end{lstlisting}

When we encounter an item we check if its parameter ($n$) has the value we are looking for ($i$). If the answer is positive, then we replace $n$ with $i'$. Otherwise we leave the item intact:
\begin{lstlisting}
instance i == n =>
         MappableItem i i' (Item n) where
  type MapItem i i' (Item n) = Item i'
  map_item i i' (Item n) = Item i'

instance i /= n =>
         MappableItem i i' (Item n) where
  type MapItem i i' (Item n) = Item n
  map_item i i' (Item n) = Item n
\end{lstlisting}

Possibly the most complex instance of an optimizable query is that of a filtering with a cartesian product inside. In this case we split the condition $cond$ into three sub-conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item $cond_{12}$, which contains those portions of $cond$ that lookup elements from both queries
\item $cond_1$, which contains those portions of $cond$ that only lookup elements from the query $q_1$
\item $cond_2$, which contains those portions of $cond$ that only lookup elements from the query $q_2$
\end{itemize}
The split is such that $cond \equiv cond_{12} \wedge cond_1 \wedge cond_2$; otherwise, we would risk creating an optimized query that yields more elements than the original one.

The optimized query is taken by creating three filterings; one with $cond_{12}$ is applied to the result of the join, while the other two respectively apply the conditions $cond_1$ and $cond_2$ to the sub-queries $q_1$ and $q_2$. The resulting join (not the outermost filter) is further optimized:
\begin{lstlisting}
instance (e1 = Elem q1,
          e2 = Elem q2,
          Splittable cond e1 e2, 
          cond12 = Shared cond e1 e2,
          cond1 = Cond1 cond e1 e2,
          cond2 = Cond2 cond e1 e2,
          OptimizableQuery (Join (Filter cond1 q1) (Filter cond2 q2))) =>
          OptimizableQuery (Filter cond (Join q1 q2)) where
  type Optimized (Filter cond (Join q1 q2)) = Filter cond12 (Optimized (Join (Filter cond1 q1) (Filter cond2 q2)))) 
  optimize (Filter cond (Join q1 q2)) =
    let cond12, cond1, cond2 = split cond
    Filter cond12 (optimize (Join (Filter cond1 q1) (Filter cond2 q2)))) 
\end{lstlisting}

Splitting a condition requires checking its shape. We look for nested sequences of $And$s and analyze the domain of each branch; we can group together those branches which lookup values from only one of the two query elements. The type class that splits a condition with respect to two query elements contains:
\begin{itemize}
\item three type functions $Shared$, $Cond1$ and $Cond2$ which compute the type of the condition split into three parts: those that access values from both elements of the sub-queries, those that access values only from the first element and those that access values only from the second element;
\item a split function that given a condition $cond$ splits its into a triplet containing its three subconditions.
\end{itemize}
\begin{lstlisting}
class Splittable cond e1 e2 where
  type Shared cond e1 e2 :: *
  type Cond1 cond e1 e2 :: *
  type Cond1 cond e1 e2 :: *
  split :: cond -> (Shared cond e1 e2, Cond1 cond e1 e2, Cond2 cond e1 e2)
\end{lstlisting}

The first instance of the splitting predicate is the fallback rule; this rule will not be matched unless all the other, more specific rules fail. This rule is required because any condition that is not an $And$ simply cannot be safely split:
\begin{lstlisting}
instance Splittable cond e1 e2 where
  type Shared (And a b) e1 e2 = cond
  type Cond1 (And a b) e1 e2 = True
  type Cond2 (And a b) e1 e2 = True
  split cond = (cond,True,True)
\end{lstlisting}

If the condition is an $And$ and both its branches access values from the first element of the query, then the entire condition will only be tested on the first sub-query:
\begin{lstlisting}
instance (Domain a e1 e2 = First, Domain b e1 e2 = First) => 
          Splittable (And a b) e1 e2 where
  type Shared (And a b) e1 e2 = True
  type Cond1 (And a b) e1 e2 = And a b
  type Cond2 (And a b) e1 e2 = True
  split (And a b) = (True, And a b, True)
\end{lstlisting}

The $Domain$ predicate is relatively straightforward, in that it simply checks whether all the $Item$s of a condition fall within the first element ($e_1$), if they access indices all greater than $Length\ e_1$ or if it access both kind of indices.

Similarly, if both branches of the $And$ only access values from the only one element of the query, then each branch needs only to be tested on the corresponding sub-query; in this case care must be taken to remap the domain of the condition $b_2$, because now it will not be applied on merged pairs of type $Flatten\ e_1\ e_2$, but rather it will be applied on values of type $e_2$:
\begin{lstlisting}
instance (Domain a e1 e2 = First, 
          Domain b e1 e2 = Second,
          RemappableDomain b e1 e2) => 
          Splittable (And a b) e1 e2 where
  type Shared (And a b) e1 e2 = True
  type Cond1 (And a b) e1 e2 = a
  type Cond2 (And a b) e1 e2 = RemapDomain b e1 e2
  split (And a b) = (True, a, b)
\end{lstlisting}

The $RemappableDomain\ cond\ e_1\ e_2$ predicate is very similar to the $MappableItem$ predicate seen above; and simply turns every instance of $Item\ i$ found inside $cond$ into an instance of $Item\ (i-Length\ e_1)$.

In case the first branch $a$ only refers to the first sub-query but the second branch $b$ also refers to the second sub-query, then we recursively split the second branch into three sub-queries; the sub-query of $b$ that refers to the first sub-query is then put in conjunction with $a$:
\begin{lstlisting}
instance (Domain a e1 e2 = First, Domain b e1 e2 = Both,
          Splittable b e1, e2) => 
          Splittable (And a b) e1 e2 where
  type Shared (And a b) e1 e2 = Shared b e1 e2
  type Cond1 (And a b) e1 e2 = And a (Cond1 b e1 e2)
  type Cond2 (And a b) e1 e2 = Cond2 b e1 e2
  split (And a b) = 
    let (b_shared,b1,b2) = split b
    (b_shared, And a b1, b2)
\end{lstlisting}

The remaining cases cover all the other possible combinations of the various domains of the branches of an $And$ condition; we omit them since they are very similar to the ones already presented.
