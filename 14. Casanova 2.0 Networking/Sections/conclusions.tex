Adding multi-player support to games is a highly desirable feature. By letting players interact with each other, new forms of gameplay, cooperation, and competition emerge without requiring any additional effort by the developer. This allows a game to remain fresh and playable, even after the single player content has been exhausted.

Multi-player support in games is a very expensive piece of software to build. Low-level protocols need to be programmed with both performance and reliability in mind, and existing abstraction mechanisms such as SOAP, RPC, etc. usually fall short from various points of view.

In this paper we have presented a model for networking especially geared towards multi-player games. This model allows the creation of robust, high-performance multi-player games based on a peer-to-peer architecture. We have shown the approach to be flexible enough to build some small game-like applications, and we have given some preliminary evidence that performance is good acceptable for real-time games both in terms of computational time required and bandwidth used.
