Taming the complexity of virtual worlds is a task that has never been fully accomplished:
- general purpose but slow engines 
- single purpose but fast engines

In this paper we presented the Casanova language:
- a language for games, rather than a library in a general purpose language
- that reduces development costs
- without sacrificing flexibility
- without sacrificing performance (through aggressive automated optimizations)
