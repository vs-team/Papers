% OPTIMIZATION AND COMPILATION
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Optimization}
Optimization with:
- memory recycling rather than re-allocation
- parallel execution
- query optimization
- on Windows, WP7 and the Xbox (and the iPad?)

\subsection{Compilation}
Compilation strategy:
- syntax
- F\# expression tree
- regular F\# compiler
- graphics and networking in other .Net languages
- sample compilation from very simple example in Section ``Casanova Language''
