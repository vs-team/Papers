Game are:
- complex
- require performance

Low-level languages do not cut it fully.

We will:
(A) discuss game constraints
  - discuss traditional approaches and their limitations
  - discuss similarities between game genres and try and find a general framework
  - define a language that is built around this general framework, and which makes it easy
  - reason on why we'd rather have a new language and not just a library
  - give syntax, typing, semantics
(B) give optimization transformations of the language
(C) give a detailed case study
  - give benchmarks that show how effective our optimizations are and how they are completely automated (they require no effort on the part of the programmer)
